// This file exports all report swagger documentation
// The actual implementation is empty because swagger-jsdoc will scan these files
// and generate the swagger spec based on the JSDoc comments

// Import documentation to ensure they are included in the build
import "./quotations-pdf.swagger";

import "./combined-pdf.swagger";

// No need to export anything as swagger-jsdoc will scan these files directly
